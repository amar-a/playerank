< playerank paper + link >

To build player rankings from soccer logs data, following steps are required:

1 - compute feature weights (learning)
2 - compute roles (learning)
3 - compute performance scores (rating)
4 - aggregate performance scores (ranking)


Soccer logs data is publicy available, upon citation, from this link: < data paper >
